         <p class="about-paragraph">My interest in design is its potential power to do good in the world, espeically within the realm of conservation and animal welfare. Having developed my creative passion originally through drawing and painting, in my design practice I try to find new, unexpected visuals. I love incorporating drawing, photography, and letterpress in my work to invoke the touch of a hand or refreshing feelings. I try let my imagination rule my process, while finding the balance of a professional feel.</p>

         <p class="about-paragraph">Drawing and painting are my time to through all caution to the wind. I let process dictate the arc of any creation as much as my own inward vision, celebrating material along the way. This manifests most explicitly in portraiture as well as in subtler forms by studying a person’s relationship to a place or even feeling.</p>

         <p class="about-paragraph">I am a Bowdoin College graduate, originally from the Boston area. I love exploring the outdoors through any means like backpacking, scuba diving, white water paddling, and more. My friends and family are the most important part of my life, and I owe my passion for art to their never-ending support. Please use the “contact” page if you are interested in starting a conversation about a commission, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks and don't forget to spread some kindness out there!</p>
