   <h2 class="title">The Control of Nature by John McPhee</h2>
   <p class="caption">Book Cover Design</p>
   <p class="blurb">In my type and image class at the Rhode Island School of Design, my professor asked us to design three book covers, and I chose one of my favorites, “The Control of Nature” by John McPhee. This book is split up into three parts that all centralize around the theme of human versus nature. The first part is about the Army Corps of Engineers trying to control the flow of of the Mississippi river. The second part is about the town of Heiymay defending their Icelandic town from lava. The third is about trying to blockade landslides from eating up Los Angeles.</p>

      <p class="book-blurb">In this first one, I traced the entire watershed of the Mississippi in the United States. I ended up using a much smaller portion because I wanted the drawing to bleed off the page, implying more movement. I ultimately settled on this modest yellow because I liked the ambiguity of the cover. Yellow also seemed like a unifying color between rivers, lava, and debris.</p>

      <p class="book-blurb">In this second cover, I built all the letters of “Nature” and a small gear cog out of white card-stock paper. I used a spotlight to experiment with the shadows of the gear as well as my hand on the letters. I wanted to suggest human’s attempt at controlling the forces of nature and felt like a gear cog was representative of artificial machines. To even the playing field between each word “control” and “nature”, I ensured that “NATURE” was larger than control.</p>

      <p class="book-blurb">In this last cover, I used letterpress to create the type features. I distorted “Nature” to make it appear as if it was running into “Control”. In this way, “Control” looks like it is blockading or damming the flow of “Nature”. I also added more white splatter to the word “Nature” as I wanted it to look messy and unwieldly. I chose red for “Control” because I wanted it to look artificial.</p>
