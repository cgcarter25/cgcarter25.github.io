   <p class="caption">Rebrand Design</p>
   <p class="blurb">As the graphic design intern at Project Chimps, I am responsible for rebranding the Chimp or Treat event. This is one of a handful of events on site that are open to the public and features trick or treating and games. Since the main event is geared towards kids and familes, we wanted the logo to be fun and inviting, but adhere to brand standards.</p>

      <p class="blurb">In my design process, I wanted to use a pumpkin because it felt like just enough of a "spook" factor for a fun event. I wanted to create a sharp image using type that would be intriguing to look at. I also needed to incorporate a chimpanzee somehow. The original logo is on the left.</p>

   <div class="post-intro">
      <img src="../img/cot-logo.png" alt="" class="cot-design">
      <p class="blurb">The final logo uses two colors within the brand standards and a simple modification of the typeface. Stretching the type seemed to be too far out of the brand standards, but I decided that rotated letters was okay. I also added the chimp icon to be more playful.</p>

      <p class="blurb-chimp">In the event banner, I used a similar text treatment on the event information as I did in the logo. I need a ligher background for printing ramifications, so I added a slight orange radial gradient to frame the information. I used a darker image and text for higher contrast.</p>
