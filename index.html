            During the vice presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris, one of the art directors and I were in a war room pulling clips from the live footage. The following morning, we decided to compile a montage of footage of Pence interrupting Harris and the moderator. I worked to pull the clips and compile the video in only 3 hours, so we could be the first to drop the video on twitter. It was liked 5,700+ times and retweeted 2,000 + times including by CNN anchor Dana Bash and Senior Advisor to President Obama Valarie Jarrett.

One trip needed to end at the design center, one at our house, and one abroad. Each trip needed to show at least 15 different events as well as how long the trip took.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-work-paragraph-2">
            <span class="about-paragraph-header">The Solution:</span> Instead of showing the length of time each trip took, I decided to show carbon footprint of each trip and how my methods of transportation contributed to the overall footprint. All the art and icons were created by hand in Adobe Illustrator.

            The infographic is designed to keep your attention and reveal more and more layers of information the closer you look. Upon first glance you may only notice the title, Earth illustration, or carbon emission graph, but then you may notice the carbon footprint definition or even the conversation I had with the TSA worker at the JFK airport.

I used secondary colors in Project Chimp's brand so as to stay within their brand but carve out a sub-brand that would suit the apiary.

            <p class="about-paragraph">Upon graduating from Bowdoin College in 2019, I found myself at the Rhode Island School of Design where I first found my infatuation with using design as both an artform and form of communication. </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">The following fall I interned at Project Chimps as a graphic design and communications intern. I then joined SKDK, voted the top public affairs agency by the Holmes report in 2019, as a graphic design intern and was promoted that summer to creative consultant so as to help the creative department with the workload during election season.</p>

            <p class="about-paragraph">I am also taking classes in UI/UX to learn the fundamentals of user-oriented design as well as applications such as Figma and Adobe XD. </p>
