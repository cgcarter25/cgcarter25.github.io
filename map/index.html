   <h2 class="title">Peachtree Map</h2>
   <p class="caption">Map Design & Animation</p>
   <p class="blurb">As the graphic design intern at Project Chimps, I recreated the map of the sanctuary grounds. Project Chimps is the United States' newest chimpanzee sancutary and their mission is to provide life-long, exemplary care to chimpanzees retired from medical research. Using a satellite tracing of the sanctuary grounds, I created an illustrative three-dimensional rendition. I then created an animation that shows the movement of chimps during a relocation phase.</p>
   <img src="../img/map.png" alt="" class="map-img">
   <p class="blurb">The map is meant for small and large scale use on print material like event maps and posters and possible web use such as in social media posts and animations like the one below. We wanted the interior to appear fun but also show key information on what is inside the 6-acre sanctuary. We decided to show six chimps to show how there are never chimpanzees alone in the habitat but there is also ample space if they do not want to socialize. We also wanted to show some play structures and other features like ponds that people may or may not see on their tour. We left out some fencing that did not seem to be important enough to show.</p>

   <p class="blurb">In the midst of two new transports of chimpanzees to Project Chimps, the sanctuary was relocating all four groups to new villas for renovations. After making the map of the Peachtree habitat, we thought it would be useful for our supporters to have a visual animation of where each group of chimps would be moving to and where the new groups would move-in thereafter.
