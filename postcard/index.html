   <h2 class="title">Logo for a Typeface</h2>
   <p class="caption">Logo and Postcard Design</p>
   <p class="blurb">In my Type and Image class at the Rhode Island School of Design, my professor asked me to design a logo for a typeface and then a postcard to advertise the typeface. I chose Akzidenz-Grotesk because I was drawn to its timeless and deep history. It was the first heavily-used sans-serif, developed at the Berthold Typeshop in Berlin in 1896, and later the inspiration for the most popular typeface of the 1900s: Helvetica. It was part of the “Grotesk” group of typefaces because these first sans-serifs were thought to be very ugly, or even grotesque. It was commonly used for posters, signage, and tickets like most early sans-serifs.</p>

      <p class="blurb">This was the final logo I decided on. I tried to make it look like a billboard of sorts, to hark back to its use in signage. I also tilted the “G” to make it look like an arrow, symbolizing the transition from serif to sans-serif. The "G" was also detested by many for its plainness.</p>

      <p class="post-blurb">I found this original poster from the Berthold Typeshop and was attracted to its ornamentation. I interpreted this assignment as honoring the typeface in its history while also putting a more modern spin on the design so as to relate to people’s taste in the present day, so I printed it out and cropped the image at various locations and angles until I found the winner. After exagerrating some elements, I chose the German flag for a color palette.</p>
