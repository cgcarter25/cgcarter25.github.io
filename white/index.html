   <p class="blurb">In my Type and Image class at the Rhode Island School of Design, my professor asked me to spend some time thinking about “white” and then to design a project inspired by the concept of white. After researching different fields of the word, I decided to juxtapose two infamous texts based on the concept: The Holy Bible and Sir Isaac Newton's original "Opticks: Or a Treatise on the Reflexions, Refractions and Inflections, and Colors of Light." By interweaving mentions of white from these texts and editing them into a new story, along with inspired photography, I attempt to show these ideas in a new light. When reading mentions of "white" in these texts, I noticed religion occupied symbol of purity and holiness. I was fascinated by the stark difference in Newton's descriptions of white light as a combination of all the colors in the rainbow. When broken up, white becomes a conglomeration of every color. It contains everything while showing nothing.</p>

      <p class="blurb">I decided to interweave mentions of white from these two texts and edit them into a new story, attempting to show these ideas in a new light. I used a projector to show selected quotes from my chosen texts on white clothes. I also used a glass prism, not unlike one Newton may have used himself, from an old chandelier to refract words and create interesting typographical images in a couple pages.</p>
