   <p class="blurb">In my Type and Image class at the Rhode Island School of Design, my professor asked me to spend some time thinking about “white” and then to design a project inspired by the concept of white. After researching different fields of the word, I decided to juxtapose two infamous texts based on the concept: The Holy Bible and Sir Isaac Newton's original "Opticks: Or a Treatise on the Reflexions, Refractions and Inflections, and Colors of Light." By interweaving mentions of white from these texts and editing them into a new story, along with inspired photography, I attempt to show these ideas in a new light. In doing so, I noticed religion occupied a motif of white representing purity in particular and delved more specifically into Catholicism. I also was drawn to the science of white light as a combination of all the colors in the rainbow. When broken up, white becomes a conglomeration of every color. It contains everything while showing nothing. In this way, I wanted to juxtapose science and religion as embodying very different meanings of white. </p>

   <p class="blurb">I used a projector to show selected quotes from my chosen texts on white clothes. For a couple pages, I also used a glass prism from an old chandelier to refract words and create interesting typographical images.</p>

   <p class="blurb">The final book is bound as an accordian to show a continuity between each page. In order to protect the whiteness and cleanliness of the final product I made a book cover.</p>
