        <p class="about-paragraph"><span class="bold-copy">Hi there! I am a graphic designer, web designer, and artist living in Bend Oregon.</span> I first dove into the creative world through drawing and visual arts classes at Bowdoin College. This led to my fascination and pursuit of graphic and web design. I studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, and have an education background in typography, color theory, web design, infographic and data visualization design, book design, and type and image design. I currently work at SKDK, a public affairs and political consulting firm, voted top public affairs firm in 2017, 2018, and 2019 by the Holmes Report. I started as a graphic design intern and was promoted in the summer of 2020 to creative consultant. I also take on freelancing projects and have worked with clients such as Nike, PerryUndem, and WholeSchool Mindfulness. In my free time, I love to whitewater paddle, ski, rock climb, and hike with my friends and family!</p>

          <p class="about-paragraph">To me, graphic design is one of the most powerful tools we have in distributing information in our increasingly more globalized and visual world. As consumers, we are constantly scrolling through information and seeing ads in our daily life. Cutting-edge graphic design is so important in capturing the viewer's attention span. I have a strong design foundation from my studies at the Rhode Island School of Design and also keep up to date with the latest trends. As a creative consultant at SKDK, I take on any project, print or digital, that is thrown at me, and pride myself in my abilities to effectively learn new programs and trends.</p>

          <p class="about-paragraph">After taking a web design class at the Rhode Island School of Design, I was hooked on the intersection of code and design. I am drawn to the problem-solving side of coding. It is a fun challenge in achieving the most effective user-experience to distribute information and meaningful stories. I know HTML, CSS, and jQuery though I prefer to use vanilla Javascript when easiest. Most recently, I have been teaching myself D3 to create interactive data visualizations. My roots in biology and science enhance my interest in distributing raw data in interesting designs that make that information accessible to anyone.</p>

          <div class="about-paragraph">My entry into design and visual storytelling was through drawing and painting classes at Bowdoin College, where I studied Visual Art. My specialties are oil painting and printmaking, but I love combining media in any form. Practicing studio art helps keep my design and illustrating skills fresh and vice versa, so I love finding time for creating with my hands and taking a break from the computer. I also think that creating color palettes with paint or ink allows me to better understand how color palettes in my designs could be more effective.</div>
